# Election Analysis Audit

The following election audit analysis has been manufactured to provide the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county including the total vote count, as well as the county with the highest turnout for the election commission. As the following groundwork was completed with Seth and Tom we will now use further repetition statements, condition statements and logical operators to print the following additional desired results.

## Tools:
Python, VS Code

 ## Results:
 - The following candidate of **Diana DeGette** has won the election with a **total vote count of 272,892 which tallies as 73.8%** of the total votes within the election.
 - There was a total of **369,711** votes casted in this congressional election
 - The county with the largest number of votes within this election outcome was **Denver with 306,055**
  
#### The following list below provide the highest to lowest number of votes and percentage of total votes:
  - Denver at 306,055 votes at 82.8%
  - Jefferson at 38,855 votes at 10.5%
  - Arapahoe at 24,801 votes at 6.7%

#### The following list below provides the highest to lowest number votes and percentage of votes between each of the three candidates
   - Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes at 73.8%
   - Charles Casper Stockham with 85,213 votes at 23.0%
   - Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 votes at 3.1%

## Summary: 

The Election-Audit Summary script can further be used for additional elections moving forward as our script will input the following results that will continually generate the following winning candidate.

To further analyze the results it would be recommended we include results to measure each candidate’s results per county. By creating another decision output statement, I believe it would be a useful visualization for the election commission to be able to measure the results of votes each candidate received per county.

As we are also provided with the ballot Id’s I believe it would be another important measurable to receive the demographics and the demographic’s results for each county to display the candidates voting count results based on gender, ethnicity, age, and education level. If we were provided with the Ballot ID’s demographics as well as import into our Election Analysis then the following desired results would then be attainable.
